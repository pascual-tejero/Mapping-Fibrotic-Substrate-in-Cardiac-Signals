# Project Title: Source Estimation in Cardiac Fibrotic Substrate from Intracardiac Signals

## Abstract:
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia globally, affecting 1-1.5% of the general population. It is commonly associated with fibrosis of cardiac tissue, involving the formation and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), which plays a significant role in the onset and maintenance of AF. Electroanatomical mapping, utilizing an array of electrodes in an intravenous catheter to measure the amplitude of electrograms (EGMs) near or on the heart's surface, is among the treatments used to combat this disease. However, this technique's reliability is limited, and its success rate is suboptimal. This project aims to explore an inverse problem reconstruction by obtaining signals from EGMs of simulated reentrant activity in fibrotic patches. The objective is to generate a map of extracellular potentials (EPs) of cardiac tissue to localize strategic ablation points promoting AF. MATLAB software implements second-order Tikhonov regularization, L-curve method, Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD), depth normalization, and Boundary Element Method (BEM) to achieve this. Additionally, activation times (ATs) and repolarization times (RTs) are calculated, and singularity points are localized using phase singularity (PS) analysis. Simulation setups include various electrode configurations and tissue conditions. While EP reconstructions were visually similar to the ground truth, AT and RT maps require improvement in identifying voltage propagation patterns. Despite some limitations, calculated RMSE values are acceptable for detecting AT and RT in fibrotic tissue. Post-analysis reveals potential in localizing reentrant points in simulated fibrotic tissue, although algorithm refinement is necessary for better results.
