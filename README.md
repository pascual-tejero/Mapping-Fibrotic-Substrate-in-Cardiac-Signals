# Mapping-Fibrotic-Substrate-in-Cardiac-Signals
Our project enhances Atrial Fibrillation (AF) treatment by refining electroanatomical mapping to locate ablation points in fibrotic tissue. Using MATLAB, we reconstruct Extracellular Potentials (EPs) from Electrogram (EGM) signals, showing promise in identifying reentrant points.
